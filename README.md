# To execute
1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:watsonben/scriptr.git`
2. Change to the new directory `cd scriptr`
3. Install dependencies `yarn`
4. Run the app `yarn dev`
5. Go to the local site where it is being run (usually `localhost:8000` or `localhost:5173`)

# How it works
You can add questions and script out the likely responses.

This has a max response size of four — this is intentional. If you think one of your questions will have more than four likely responses it is not a good question and you should choose a different one.

Some answers will require the same follow-up question from you — you can link to other questions in this case.

Once you have scripted it out, you can enter presentation mode where you can easily follow through the script off to the side during the conversation.

# Use cases
This was originally designed for giving feedback and coaching as a manager.

However, it's seen use in scripting sales calls too.

Honestly, use it for whatever you want.
